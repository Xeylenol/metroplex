            <p>Alice sat in front of the array of monitors, her eyes bloodshot from sleepless nights. The data was grim. The virus was mutating faster than they could keep up. No matter what treatments they tested, it adapted. The world outside was a shell of what it once was, cities abandoned, governments silent, and the few remaining survivors scattered in hiding.
                Ben is either 30 or 45 years old, and his clearance level is not Alpha or Delta.
                Ben entered the room, a heavy sigh escaping him as he glanced at the monitors. "Nothing. We’re running out of time, Alice. People are dying by the second."
                Alice didn’t look up. "I know. But we can’t stop now. We need to find a way to stop it."
                Clara joined them, her hands trembling slightly as she held a tablet. "The situation outside is worse than ever. It’s spreading faster. We’ve lost contact with all the other research teams. We’re the last ones left."
                The person who specializes in Physics is 35 years old.
                David, who had been staring out the small, grimy window into the dark, empty world outside, spoke softly, almost to himself. "How much longer can we keep fighting this? We're out of options."
                The person who is 40 years old specializes in Chemistry and likes Beta.
                "We can’t stop," Alice replied firmly, her voice tinged with exhaustion. "The world will end if we do."
                Clara’s clearance level is Gamma and she does not specialize in Mathematics.
                Days blurred into one another as the team worked relentlessly, struggling to make any meaningful progress. But every breakthrough was met with failure, every promising solution destroyed by a new mutation.
                The person who specializes in Biology is 30 years old and has Gamma clearence.
                One evening, Clara rushed into the lab, her eyes wide with fear. "I think I found something—something strange. The virus, it’s… it's evolving faster than we predicted. But it’s not just random. It’s almost as though it’s... learning."
                The person who specializes in Biology is 30 years old and has Gamma clearence.
                The team gathered around her workstation, staring at the data. Clara’s fingers hovered over the screen, scrolling through an endless sequence of genetic material. "Look at this. It’s adapting to every treatment, every method we’ve used so far. It’s as if someone is controlling it."
                The person who specializes in Biology is 30 years old and has Gamma clearence.
                Ben shook his head. "That doesn’t make sense. Viruses can’t be controlled like that. What are you saying, Clara?"
                "I’m not sure," Clara admitted, her voice shaking. "But the mutations are too deliberate. Too precise. It’s almost like... someone is guiding it. This might not just be a virus—it could be something more."
                David's gaze grew darker as he processed her words. "A weapon, you mean?"
                Clara nodded, her face pale. "I don’t know. But if that’s true, we’ve been fighting something we don't fully understand. And if we don’t stop it now, it’ll be too late."
                The days grew longer as the situation worsened. The virus continued to spread, adapting to every attempt they made to stop it. The facility had become a prison. They were trapped, cut off from the outside world, with only the distant echoes of the world’s downfall reaching them through the occasional broadcast.
                Alice is older than the person who specializes in Physics, but younger than the person who specializes in Mathematics.
                "We’re too late," Ben said one night, his voice breaking. "Even if we find something, it won’t matter. The world is already gone."
                David’s clearance level is not Delta or Gamma.
                Clara sat down at her workstation, her eyes unfocused. "What’s the point of saving a world that’s already dead? Maybe we should stop trying to fix it and just survive."
                David, who had been silent for hours, finally spoke. "We were never going to survive this. The virus is too powerful, too adaptable. We’ve been chasing a solution that doesn’t exist. And now, it’s too late."
                The person who has clearence Delta specializes in Mathematics.
                Alice paced the room, her mind racing. She refused to believe it was hopeless. "We can’t just give up. We can still stop it."
                But deep down, she knew she was lying to herself. They were running out of time. Their research had stalled, their treatments had failed, and the virus had already claimed most of the world.
