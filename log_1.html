        <div class="log-entry">
            <p>The disease, <span class="highlight">Zeta X</span>, was a swift killer. It spread through the air, its symptoms starting as a simple cough before quickly escalating into fever, delirium, and then death. Scientists had tried and failed to develop a cure, and now the disease had infected most of the population. Desperation hung in the air, and no one felt safe.</p>

        <!-- Mayor John -->
        <div class="log-entry">
            <p><span class="highlight">Mayor John</span>, once a proud leader of a bustling city, now found himself leading a group of survivors through the ruins, trying to maintain some sense of order. He paced nervously around the conference table, scanning the faces of his companions. "We need a solution," he said, his voice raw with the weight of his responsibility. "We can't let Zeta X wipe us out. We've survived this long, and we need to fight back."</p>

            <p><span class="highlight">Senator Tom</span>, the oldest of the group, had seen his fair share of political battles, but nothing had prepared him for this. His once imposing stature now seemed frail and worn. "It's not about the people anymore," he said hoarsely. "It's about surviving... for as long as we can. We can’t cure it, but maybe we can at least make our final stand count."</p>
